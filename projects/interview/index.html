                I studied painting at university, but my interest gradually shifted to ephemeral matters. In 1998, I started a collective project called <em>“pop-up café”</em> with my college friends and other architects studying for their Ph.D. in Japan. The event was a kind of salon that asked questions such as “how public space and facilities do not function in Tokyo” and “what is the void in urban functions? We raised funds for activities by creating, cooking, and selling café style menus. I worked part-time during the week for about two years and worked at night and weekends.<br>

                <a href="https://www.asakoiwama.net/pop-up-cafe/" target="_blank">“pop-up café”</a> is a temporary site for dialogue that occasionally appears in different cities, each questioning a different set of boundaries. By identifying the context and parameters of the set topic, questioning its various aspects, and examining our positions, relations, and dynamics, we effectively cross and transform boundaries. The pop-up cafe’s purpose is to open new perspectives and trigger practical initiatives. Asako Iwama, Seiji Ohba, Yoshiko Morita, Yayoi Yamashiro

                <div class="indent">There’s no place in Tokyo without paying money where you can talk comfortably without paying attention to time. I felt uncomfortable in such a situation. On the other hand, we had close exchanges to learn from the perspective of members from various countries such as Germany and Turkey. I met A12, a collective of young architects working in Italy, and visited Rome through such a relationship.<br></div>
                <div class="indent">When I attended a workshop involving A12, I met the Kurdish people who arrived as refugees from Kurdistan and were staying in Rome. At the center of this space and workshop was Stalker, a group of Roman architects. They were involved in the refugees through workshops, exploring urban migration in cities, and the margins and boundaries of the areas where people live.<br></div>
                <div class="indent">Participants in the workshop included Kurds without their homeland, a group of organizations, nomadic Romans, and me who happened to be there. Inspired by the casual atmosphere of people from various backgrounds, I participated in the lunch-making program as a visitor from outside the community. When the “Stalker” members announced the program on the radio, people came from all over the city, and we lined up a large round table in the center of the space and shared a meal.<br></div>

                <a href="https://www.asakoiwama.net/campo-pranzo-boario/" target="_blank">“Campo Boario”</a> is a vast industrial complex in the Testaccio area of Rome, built at the end of the 19th century as a slaughterhouse and food processing facility. After the complex ceased production in 1975, the area was left to abandonment, and in 1999, the interdisciplinary collective Stalker began to squat a building of the former Mattatoio slaughterhouse. The participants worked together during the lunch preparation program to prepare dishes from their own countries, and I served miso soup with clams.

            <div class="indent">It was impressive to see the simplicity and lightness of creating a space where you can feel each other’s culture through food. The process responds in detail to people’s relationships and circumstances. The places I encountered and the open conversations and meals I had there were comfortable and free, making me want to go out of Japan.<br></div>
            <div class="indent">When organizing a “pop-up cafe” in Japan, I learned a simple system in which food and drinks create places where people gather and create an economy. When I saw it again in Rome, I was fascinated by the ephemeral nature of food that loses its shape when eaten and where people gather and create. It was necessary to leave it as an object, not an ephemeral one.<br><br><br></div>

                I’d love to hear about your experience at Olafur Eliasson’s Studio Kitchen. Many people used SOE Kitchen. Was there any difficulty as a cook? What are the characteristics or nature of an eating community that artists need? Any special recipes?<br>
          </div>
          <div class="text-ai">
                AI: <br>
                It was ten years of observing and thinking about changes in the community around food.
                <div class="indent">A friend who knew about my practice said, “We need someone who can cook for many groups. “Will you come?” I didn’t know who Olafur Eliasson was. It was in the summer of 2005. Not long after my grandmother passed away, I thought I had no more home to go back to. My grandmother loved to eat, and many memories of her are full of scenes of eating together. It was such a situation that I was offered the job. At first, the studio had a very small kitchen and only about 25 members. Preparing meals alone for so many of them was a struggle against my energy limitations, and I had to negotiate a lot to improve the working environment.<br></div>
                <div class="indent">As the number of members is increasing rapidly, the menu has been changed to organic vegetarianism in consideration of our financial situation. Since there are many people of various nationalities in the studio, they are from different cultures. They have different health conditions, different food allergies, and different ideas about what is “delicious” to them. Knowing these differences, we investigated issues behind the production, logistics, and distribution of materials and discussed a lot about the kitchen. These interactions with studio members were critical, and negotiations and spontaneous suggestions provided an opportunity to visualize the importance of daily meals that were not commonly considered and to learn more about the ingredients we cook together.<br></div>
                <div class="indent">Believing that attitudes change long term, we patiently provided such information and reflected it in our meals. In addition to choosing organic ingredients, we also streamlined the cooking process and addressed the issue of waste. Events inside and outside the kitchen were like a microcosm of the world, observing how studio members were emotionally affected by food distribution and learning how to maintain a system that expands as they change through trial and error.<br></div>
                <div class="indent">In response to a request to collect meal recipes provided by the studio, we created <em>“Take Your Time Vol. 5: The Kitchen, ”</em>&nbsp;* inspired by keywords that I had been thinking about since the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011. I proposed a concept to Olafur Eliasson.We had a series of meetings with editors and graphic designers, took pictures of food with photographers every day while preparing meals, and invited people we met at the studio to contribute to publications. As a result, a work that can be said to be a portrait of everyone who worked in the studio was born. I think we were able to visualize many things, such as the idea of care labor, the process of food production, and the cycle between humans and nature.<br></div>
          </div>
          <div class="caption">
                *&nbsp;The book was later renamed <a href="https://www.asakoiwama.net/pop-up-cafe/" target="_blank">“Studio Olafur Eliasson The Kitchen”</a> and published in English and French by Phaidon, also in German and in Japanese by Bijutsu Shuppan.
          </div>
          <div class="text-ai">
                <div class="indent">After that, I returned to Japan, where I was away for 13 years, and studied in the master’s department of the Tama University of Art. During these two years, I learned video editing techniques and practiced writing and thinking in Japanese again, and it was a special time for me, who has been working and working in art all my life. Inspired by my young classmates and teachers, I produced two videos at school. In addition, the ease of being in a Japanese-speaking environment was also fresh, and I realized that my part was tired of the constant need to explain everything in words in Germany.</div>
                <div class="indent">When I was in my second year of graduate school, I participated in a food-themed group exhibition at the invitation of Arts Maebashi(museum in Gunma prefecture). I exhibited an installation work called “Our Body is a Small Universe.” I had cosmology in mind at that time, and I thought about the chapter Mineral, “Take Your Time Vol. 5: The Kitchen, “and radiation contamination caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake.<br><br><br></div>

                Pinocchio<br><br>
                AI: <br>
                JVE’s open studio was in the early stages of the 2020 pandemic, so it proceeded on time. Immediately after the open studio, I participated in the group exhibition “Things Entangling” (2020) held at the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo and returned to Japan to install my work “Pinocchio”. However, as the situation worsened, I shortened my stay and returned to Germany. I had a plan to go back to JVE, but I couldn’t because of the lockdown.<br></div>
          <div class="caption">
                The installation produced for this exhibition, <a href="https://www.asakoiwama.net/pinocchio/"target="_blank">“Pinocchio”</a> (2020), is one such project. It began when the artist learned that the Japanese imperial army had attempted to develop alternative aviation fuel from pine roots toward World War II. She investigated the historical background and chemical research to render pine tree sap the fluid for circulating nutrition and closing wounds into energy used for wars, as well as the use of pine in France and Germany, where the artist resides. She visited pine forests still remaining in Germany, making molds of the scars left on pine trunks and collecting resin from the trees. Through her archival research, she produced a series of prints from the traces of the bodies of workers who engage in the extraction of pine sap, including their extraction tools and distillation devices.
                Pinocchio is an installation assembling pieces produced in this process of physical engagement and research. Different forms of resin and objects reminiscent of distillation point toward the contention with human forces that transforms this natural element, as well as this long, close relationship that reflects the condition of human society. The title of the piece, appropriated from Carlo Collodi’s The Adventures of Pinocchio, reflects the story of a pine trunk (Pino = pine) becoming a human child.
                As another figure in which humans and pine meet, Iwama additionally created a small print with the image of the “pine hermit” from Taoism, said to eat pine needles in order to attain eternal life. The nexuses of pine trees and humans generate alterities without delineating linear histories or fixed meanings, offering the possibility for viewers to find their own micro-views and narratives.

                A mound of shells / 貝塚<br><br>
                <div class="indent">The Yokohama Triennale 2020 was held in the summer of a pandemic. Originally, I planned to visit Sri Lanka to follow my father’s footage, but the travel ban made me reconsider what I could do in that situation. Berlin was locked down, and my children’s nursery school was closed, making it difficult to find time to do projects. After my family fell asleep in the middle of the night, I recorded the narration with my voice to work on the video. The video is about my father, a young sociologist who crossed the sea fifty years ago with ideas and passion but began to lose his balance between mind and body. I tried to describe the landscape, including my perspective of what it means to “belong” and live as an immigrant away from Japan by overlapping my father’s diary and photos with my hometown landscape as a child.</div>

He had observed the problems of colonization and farming in Sri Lanka and the escalating ethnic conflict.

                Hands Correspondance<br><br>
                <div class="indent">Hands Correspondence, a video project collaborated with Iris Lacoudre and Camille Sineau in the context of the fifth Istanbul Design Biennial. Empathy Revisited: Designs for more than one(2021).</div>
                <div class="indent">Kitchen tools provide a support structure that generates social, environmental, and spatial situations due to related gestures and relationships. In this work, the tool is reduced to the most archaic form―the hand and the body by extension. Rather than inventing new tools, it focuses on the tactility of making and sharing food in the simplest, most intimate, and domestic form.</div>
                <div class="indent">The conversation between Asako Iwama, Iris Lacoudre, and Camille Sineau unfolded in their separate kitchens, in front of screens, in three different cities. Their initial idea―to prepare a shared meal around a large sofa, as a way to celebrate the hand as a tool―was suddenly impossible. They were cut off from each other because they were prohibited from moving, touching, or sharing. What had to be an open meeting and performance was moved to the intimate area of each apartment. The absence of that dinner has revealed that everyday cooking gestures are shared across borders beyond the confines of private kitchens.</div><br>

                And…<br><br>
                <div class="indent">Recently, I have been doing research and conducting on-site work on a piece of land in the northeast of Japan that I inherited in 2019.</div>
                <div class="indent">The core theme is about the food chain around that land. I am thinking of the limits on our first-generation physicality. It will be presented as an installation video at the beginning of next year at <a href="https://www.ycam.jp/en/aboutus/"target="_blank">YCAM</a>. The project is being developed with Mr. Kazutoshi Tsuda Ph.D., and Ms. Takahara, a researcher and technician from InterLab at <a href="https://www.ycam.jp/en/aboutus/interlab/"target="_blank">YCAM.</a></div>
