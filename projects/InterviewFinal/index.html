                I studied painting at university, but my interest gradually shifted to ephemeral matters. In 1998, I started a collective project called
                <em>“<a href="https://www.asakoiwama.net/pop-up-cafe/" target="_blank">pop–up café</a>”</em>
                with my college friends and  architects from other countries studying in Japan. This project was a kind of salon that asked questions such as “How do public spaces and facilities function or not function in Tokyo?” and “What is the void in urban functions?”. We raised funds for activities by creating menu, cooking, and selling and offering dishes. During this time I was still working in corporate environment during the week. I could only work for this project in the evening and weekend.

                is a temporary site for dialogue that occasionally appears in different cities, each questioning a different set of boundaries. By identifying the context and parameters of the set topic, questioning its various aspects, and examining our positions, relations, and dynamics, we effectively cross and transform boundaries. The pop-up cafe’s purpose is to open new perspectives and trigger practical initiatives.<br>

                    There’s no place in Tokyo where you can talk comfortably without paying attention to time and without paying money. I felt uncomfortable in such a situation. At the same time, we were learning a lot from the exchanges with other members from various countries such as Germany and Turkey. I met A12, a collective of young architects working in Italy, and visited Rome through such a relationship.<br>
                </div>
                <div class="indent">
                    There I attended a workshop involving A12, and I met several Kurdish refugees and Roma people. At the center of this workshop was Stalker, a group of Italian architects, who were working with the refugees in the context of some workshops, exploring urban migration in cities, and the margins and boundaries of the areas where people live.<br>

                <div class="indent">
                    Inspired by the casual atmosphere of people from various backgrounds, I participated in the lunch–making program as a visitor from outside the community. When the Stalker members announced the program on the radio, people came from all over the city, and we lined up a large round table in the center of this space and shared a meal.<br>

                is a vast industrial complex in the Testaccio area of Rome, built at the end of the 19th century as a slaughterhouse and food processing facility. After the complex ceased production in 1975, the area was left to abandonment, and in 1999, the interdisciplinary collective Stalker began to squat a building of the former Mattatoio slaughterhouse. The participants worked together during the lunch preparation program to prepare dishes from their own countries, and I served miso soup with clams.

                    It was impressive to see the simplicity and lightness of creating a space where you can feel each other’s culture through food. The process responds in detail to people’s relationships and circumstances. The places I encountered and the open conversations and meals I had there were comfortable and free, which was so different from the experiences I was having in Japan. This made me think of going out of Japan.<br>

                    While organizing “<em>pop–up cafe</em>” in Japan, I learned how offering food and drinks can create a place where people can gather and create an economy. When I saw it again in Rome, I was fascinated by the ephemeral nature of food that loses its shape when eaten and where people gather and create. The ephemeral aspect of these gathering and the food was very important to me.

                I’d love to hear about your experience at Olafur Eliasson’s Studio Kitchen. Many people used SOE Kitchen. Was there any difficulty as a cook? What are the characteristics or nature of an eating community that artists need? Any special recipes?<br>
            </div>
            
            <div class="text-ai">
                AI: <br>
                I started working there in the summer of 2005. A friend who knew about my practice said, “We need someone who can cook for many people. Will you come? We are never ready in time.” What followed was ten years of observing and thinking about transformation of a community around a shared meal.
            
                <div class="indent">
                    Around the same time my grandmother passed away, and I thought I had no more home to go back to. My grandmother loved to eat, and many memories of her are full of scenes of eating together. It was at that moment that I was offered the job and I decided to stay in Germany and take it on. At first, the studio had a very small kitchen and only about 25 members. Preparing meals alone for so many of them was a struggle against my energy limitations, and I had to negotiate a lot to improve the working environment.<br>
                </div>
                <div class="indent">
                    As the number of members was increasing rapidly, the menu was changing to organic vegetarian dishes in consideration of our financial situation. Since there are many people of various nationalities in the studio, they are from different cultures. They have different health conditions, different food allergies, and different ideas about what is “delicious” to them. Knowing these differences, we investigated issues around the production, logistics, and distribution of materials and discussed a lot about the kitchen. These interactions with studio members were critical, and negotiations and spontaneous suggestions provided an opportunity to highlight the importance of daily meals that were not commonly considered and to learn more about the ingredients we use to cook together.<br>
                </div>
                <div class="indent">
                    Believing that attitudes can change in the long term, we patiently provided such information and reflected it in our meals. In addition to choosing organic ingredients, we also streamlined the cooking process and addressed the issue of waste. Events inside and outside the kitchen were like a microcosm of the world, observing how studio members were emotionally affected by food distribution and learning how to maintain a system that expands as they change through trial and error.<br>
                </div>
                <div class="indent">
                    In response to a request to collect meal recipes provided by the studio, we created “<a href="https://www.asakoiwama.net/pop-up-cafe/" target="_blank"><em>Take Your Time Vol. 5: The Kitchen,</em></a>”* inspired by keywords that I had been thinking about since the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 and a concept I proposed to Olafur Eliasson.
                    We had a series of meetings with editors and graphic designers, took pictures of food with photographers every day while preparing meals, and invited people we met at the studio to contribute to publications. As a result, a work that can be said to be a portrait of everyone who worked in the studio was created. I think we were able to visualize many things, such as the idea of care labor, the process of food production, and the cycle between humans and nature.<br>

                    Around 2015 I returned to Japan after being away for 13 years, and studied in the performing arts department of the Tama University of Art. During these two years, I learned video editing techniques and practiced writing and thinking in Japanese again, and it was a special time for me. After so many years of working I could finally focus more on my artistic practice and worked on a series of video projects.

                    In 2016 I participated in a food-themed group exhibition at the invitation of the Arts Maebashi museum in Gunma prefecture. I exhibited an installation work called “Our Body is a Small Universe.” I had cosmology in mind at that time, and I thought about the chapter Mineral from “Take Your Time Vol. 5: The Kitchen,” and radiation contamination caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake.

                <div class="indent">
                    In 2019-2020 I was a fellow at the Jan van Eyck Academy in Maastricht together with many artists from all around the world. There I had the chance to do research for some of my projects and experiment with various materials and techniques. Afterwards, I participated in the group exhibition “Things Entangling” held at the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo in 2020 and returned to Japan to install my work “<em><a href="https://www.asakoiwama.net/pinocchio/"target="_blank">Pinocchio</em></a>”. It is about pine sap production in different period of time, industrialization in France, end of second world war in Japan and cold period in east Germany. I made field research and traced historical facts which were then presented along with some casts and prints in an installation

                    However, as the situation worsened worldwide because of the pandemic, I shortened my stay and returned to Germany. I was planning to go back to Jan van Eyck, but I couldn’t because of the lockdown.

                With her professional experience as a chef and interest in the production, distribution, and consumption of food and labor, the circulation of resources, and the social relationships they create, Asako Iwama has organized various types of workshops and performances for collective discourse. Her recent work includes videos and objects of various media made in collaboration with others, reflecting systems of society by way of shifts in the technological, ecological, and cultural relationships between humans and natural materials.<br>
                The installation produced for this exhibition, “<em><a href="https://www.asakoiwama.net/pinocchio/"target="_blank">Pinocchio</em></a> (2020), is one such project. It began when the artist learned that the Japanese imperial army had attempted to develop alternative aviation fuel from pine roots toward World War II. She investigated the historical background and chemical research to render pine tree sap the fluid for circulating nutrition and closing wounds into energy used for wars, as well as the use of pine in France and Germany, where the artist resides. She visited pine forests still remaining in Germany, making molds of the scars left on pine trunks and collecting resin from the trees. <br> ... <br>

                    The Yokohama Triennale 2020 was held in the first summer of the pandemic. I was initially planning to visit Sri Lanka to look for a place where my father had spent time from 1968 onwards, but the travel ban made me reconsider. Berlin was locked down, and my son’s nursery school was closed, making it difficult to find time to work. So I had to find other solutions, like recording voiceover for the video in the middle of the night when my family was sleeping. The video is about my father, a young sociologist who crossed the sea fifty years ago with ideas and passion but began to lose his balance between mind and body. At that time my father was observing the problems of colonization and farming in Sri Lanka and the escalating ethnic conflict. I tried to describe the landscape, including my perspective of what it means to “belong” and live as an immigrant away from Japan by juxtaposing my father’s diary and photos with my hometown landscape as a child.

This ethnographer stayed in a crop–farming village in a Tamil Eelam region of Sri Lanka. Speaking over footage where she examines various archive materials–diaries, maps, agricultural research documents, black–and–white photographs of the landscape–the artist reflects in digressive, essayistic mode on agricultural water channels, mounting concern about nuclear power, and her parents’ house in Kamaishi, which was destroyed by the 2011 tsunami that precipitated the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.<br>Text by Koichiro Osaka

                    “Hands Correspondence” was a video project made in collaboration with Iris Lacoudre and Camille Sineau in the context of the fifth Istanbul Design Biennial Empathy Revisited: Designs for more than one (2021).

                    Kitchen tools provide a support structure that generates social, environmental, and spatial situations due to related gestures and relationships. In this work, the tool is reduced to the most archaic form–the hand and the body by extension. Rather than inventing new tools, it focuses on the tactility of making and sharing food in the simplest, most intimate, and domestic form.

                    Our conversation with Iris Lacoudre and Camille Sineau unfolded in our separate kitchens, in front of screens, in three different cities. Our initial idea–to prepare a shared meal around a large sofa, as a way to celebrate the hand as a tool–was suddenly impossible. We were cut off from each other because we were prohibited from moving, touching, or sharing. What was planned as an open meeting and performance was moved to the intimate area of each apartment. The absence of that dinner has revealed that everyday cooking gestures are shared across borders beyond the confines of private kitchens.

                    Recently, I have been doing research and conducting on–site work on a piece of land in northeast Japan that I inherited in 2019. The core theme is about the food chain in relation to that land. I am thinking about the limits on our first–generation physicality and following some threads from my previous projects. This research will come together as a video installation at the Yamaguchi Center for Arts and Media (<a href="https://www.ycam.jp/en/aboutus/"target="_blank">YCAM</a>) in early 2023.
