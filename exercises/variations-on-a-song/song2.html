      One, two, three, four
      Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
      Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
      I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
      And tonight had something wonderful
      My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
      Conversations with a stranger I barely know
      Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
      I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
      My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
      And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
      Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
      Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
    </div>
    <div class="two">
      My bad habits lead to you
      Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
      My bad habits lead to you
      Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
      My bad habits lead to you
      Every pure intention ends when the good times start
      Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
      It started under neon lights, and then it all got dark
      I only know how to go too far
      My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
      Conversations with a stranger I barely know
      Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
      I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
      My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
      And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
      Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
      Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
      My bad habits lead to you
      Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
      My bad habits lead to you
      Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
      We took the long way 'round
      Burned 'til the fun ran out, now</div>
